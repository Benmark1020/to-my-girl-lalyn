        <p>Hi love,</p>

        <p>
           Hello my dear, Happy Valentine's Day! 🥀💗 I want to express how deeply I love you, even though we occasionally have disagreements. Despite the challenges we face, our bond remains strong. Just hold on, my love; we will reunite after graduation. I prefer to demonstrate my loyalty through my actions rather than merely stating it. You know that there were times when you were late, but the past is behind us. My love for you is unique because you have transformed me. Even as a simple man, you continue to embrace me. Each day, I admire you and find joy in your smile, even in photographs. I love you immensely, and I want you to focus on what brings you happiness, whether it be your studies or any pursuits that will benefit your future. Engage in what you are passionate about and enjoy every moment. Take care of our little ones; I am their father, just joking! Happy Valentine's Day! Please stay safe for your family, remain kind, beautiful, and adorable.
        </p>

        <p>
            I’m so lucky to have you. I love you more every single day.
        </p>

        <p><b>Forever yours, Benmark ❤️</b></p>
